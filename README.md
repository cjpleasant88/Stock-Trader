## This application was created following course at Udemy.com

> https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/learn/

####Notes:

- It is currently using an outdated version of bootstrap (i.e. panel vs card)
- The app uses vue-resource vs axios for its http get and post calls 
- The calls are tied to a Google FireBase backend to save data within a single session in .json format
